# Overview

Xiaomi (or Aqara or Mijia) has a family of products intended to be part of a Smart Home environment that whoever can install and use. They are beautiful and simple, but the associated *cloud app* sometimes does **not** fill our requirements (for instance, **cloudless control**).

Thus, here we present a **Python library** that you could use to interact with those devices, *changing* its state and *receiving events* from their sensors. Let's review what you will need to follow up.

# Ingredients
# Setting up the environment
# Connection to the Gateway
# Receiving events
# Sending actions
