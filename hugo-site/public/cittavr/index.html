  CittaVR for Unity is a framework that allows you to create <b>virtual twins</b> for real environments
</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>CittaVR for Unity is a Unity framework that allows you to create
<strong>virtual twins</strong> for real environments, to <strong>manipulate or sense</strong>
the state and status of your sensors and actuators.</p>
<p>It is available for (and compatible with) both Linux and Windows
platforms, but this manual focuses only on the <strong>Unity Editor</strong> for
GNU/Linux systems. On the other hand, as always with Unity, you can
create your models using the same editor (with
<a href="https://unity3d.com/es/unity/features/worldbuilding/probuilder">ProBuilder</a>),
or an external tool, like <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the installation.</p>
<h1 id="installation-of-unity-on-linux">Installation of Unity on Linux</h1>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  Note:
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To <strong>download</strong> the most recent version of the Editor (or any older one), you
should use the <strong>Unity Hub</strong>, which could be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unity3d.com/es/get-unity/download">Download Unity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Mark it as <strong>executable</strong> and run it (you could, of course, do it from the GUI):</p>
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>chmod a&#43;x UnityHub.AppImage
./UnityHub.AppImage</pre>
</div>
<p>Once you start the Hub, you could go to the <strong>Installs</strong> tab and add the version
you prefer:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity-hub-add-version.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity Hub: adding a Unity version</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Also, you will need an external tool for editing the source code (in
C#). You may use whatever you want (like Emacs or Atom), but the
recommended IDE (and what has better integration) is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio
Code</a>. You can just grab the <code>.deb</code>
package and install it like any other Debian package.</p>
<p>Now, you are <strong>ready to start</strong> a new Unity project and add support for CittaVR
to it. Let&rsquo;s see how.</p>
<h1 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h1>
<p>This step is very straightforward: just open the Unity Hub (if you closed it)
and go to the <strong>Projects</strong> tab. Click on the <strong>New</strong> button. Select the project
type, its location and also the name:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity-hub-new-project.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity Hub: creating a new project</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Press on <code>Create</code> and wait. It <strong>will take some time</strong> to
compile the minimum assets included by default on every new
project. Just wait until it finishes and shows the Unity Editor with
your newly created project.</p>
<h2 id="setting-net-framework">Setting .NET framework</h2>
<p>First thing you should do is to <strong>change your project settings</strong>, because by
default, it uses <em>.NET Standard 2.0</em>, which is not yet fully compatible with
ZeroC Ice and other libraries.</p>
<p>So, go to <code>Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player</code>. This will open a new <em>inspector</em>
window with some of your project settings. Open the section called <code>Other Settings</code> and find the <code>API Compatibility Level</code>, as seen in the following
picture:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20net%20version.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: change the .NET version</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Set it to <code>.NET 4.x</code> and close the inspector. It will <strong>compile again</strong> all your
assets using the new framework version, so please wait.</p>
<h2 id="open-c-project">Open C# project</h2>
<p>Now is a good time to <strong>check your IDE integration</strong> (if you want to use an IDE,
anyway). To configure the recommended settings, got to <code>Edit &gt; Preferences</code>. In
the tab <code>External Tools</code>, change the property <code>External Script Editor</code> to
&ldquo;<em>Visual Studio Code Insiders</em>&rdquo; (click on <em>Browse</em> if needed). You can see this
dialog in the following screenshot:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20external%20editor%20setting.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: external source editor setting</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>And to open the C# project, just right click on an empty space of
your Aassets folder, and click on <code>Open C# Project</code>:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index//unity%20-%20open%20cs%20project.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: open C# project with your IDE</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>If you now see VS Code open, and <strong>loaded with your Unity project</strong>,
well done! You are ready for rock &rsquo;n roll! ;)</p>
<h2 id="setup-of-idm-router">Setup of IDM router</h2>
<p>CittaVR may use IDM as its internal middleware for communicating with external
objects and to receive incoming invocations. So, if you want to enable the IDM
support, first thing you should do is to <strong>setup an IDM Router</strong> (in case you
don&rsquo;t have already one). Don&rsquo;t worry, its pretty easy. Just make sure you
<strong>installed</strong> the IDM Debian package (or do it now!) and create a new
configuration file for it (call it <code>router.config</code>). I usually put it on the
<code>Assets</code> folder:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/vscode%20-%20router%20config.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>VS Code: create the IDM router config file</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Next, add the following <strong>properties</strong> (and adjust them to suit your
needs):</p>
<div class="app-skin">
  <div class="filename">
    
      router.config
    
  </div>
  
  <pre><code class='language-ini'>Router.Adapter.Endpoints = tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6140
Router.Table.Path = router.table
Router.Ids = 0A01C17400000001</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To <strong>launch the router</strong>, just use this configuration file:</p>
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>idm-router --Ice.Config=router.config</pre>
</div>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/vscode%20-%20running%20idm%20router.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>IDM: running the router with your settings</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<h2 id="add-cittavr-config-file">Add CittaVR config file</h2>
<p>CittaVR uses a configuration file to store some of its settings (in particular,
<strong>where</strong> is the IDM router you want to use, if any). So, let&rsquo;s <strong>create</strong> a
CittaVR configuration file. The file must be located in the
<code>Assets/StreamingAssets</code> folder (we use this location in order to ensure that
Unity will bundle them when building), and be called <code>cittavr.config</code>. You
may specify the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>IDM.Router.Proxy</code></strong>, which is clearly the proxy of your IDM router. If you
used the previous configuration file, this value would be <code>0A01C17400000001 -t -e 1.0:tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6140</code>. <strong>Note:</strong> if you are contacting with
<strong>IceC</strong> devices, remember that you <strong>must</strong> add <code>-e 1.0</code> here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>CittaVR.Adapter.Endpoints</code></strong>, as CittaVR will expose <strong>virtual objects</strong> to
the real world, you will need to specify <strong>the endpoints</strong> where they should
be contacted. These virtual objects will be <strong>registered</strong> on the given IDM
router, so these endpoints <strong>must</strong> be reachable by the router.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>CittaVR.Id</code></strong>, as we will see later, CittaVR provides an object to
<strong>dynamically instantiate</strong> new objects. This is the identity of this object.
You should put here something in the <strong>same domain</strong> as your router (in this
example, something like <code>0A01C17400000001</code>), and make sure that there are
<strong>enough free addresses</strong> starting from this one, as the new dynamic objects
will be using them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is a <strong>full configuration</strong> file, which uses the previously
defined router:</p>
<div class="app-skin">
  <div class="filename">
    
      cittavr.config
    
  </div>
  
  <pre><code class='language-ini'>IDM.Router.Proxy = 0A01C17400000001 -t -e 1.0:tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6140
CittaVR.Adapter.Endpoints = tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9001
CittaVR.Id = 0A01C17400000002</code></pre>
</div>
<h1 id="installing-zeroc-ice-for-unity">Installing ZeroC Ice for Unity</h1>
<p>As you may already know, CittaVR <strong>uses ZeroC Ice</strong>, so before
anything else, you must install it. ZeroC provides its libraries and
tools for C# using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet repositories</a>,
and there is a <strong>plugin</strong> to add support for NuGet to Unity, so this is
what you need to install.</p>
<p>First, <strong>download the plugin</strong> in the following site (is an asset in the form
of <code>.unitypackage</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity/releases">NuGetForUnity github releases</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In my case, I downloaded the 2.0 version. Then, you can <strong>import it</strong>: right
click on Assets folder and select <code>Import Package &gt; Custom Package...</code>:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity-import-custom-package.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: import custom package</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Select the file you downloaded and click on Open. It will show you a window with
the assets to import. Select all and press <code>Import</code>. It may take a while, so be
patient. Once finished, you should see a new <strong>menu entry</strong>:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20nuget%20menu%20entry.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: NuGet correctly installed and compiled</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Ok. Go to <code>NuGet &gt; Manage NuGet Packages</code>. It will open a new tab that
allows you to install new packages. It may open as a <strong>floating
window</strong>, so feel free to drag it where the other tabs are, to expand
it. Now, press on <code>Search</code> and find the package called
<code>zeroc.ice.net</code>:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/nuget%20-%20zeroc%20ice%20net.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>NuGet: installing ZeroC package</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Press on <strong>install</strong> and let it finish. When done, you are ready to
include the CittaVR packages!</p>
<h1 id="adding-cittavr-assets">Adding CittaVR assets</h1>
<p>Until now, we only <strong>set up</strong> the environment to work with CittaVR,
but we didn&rsquo;t install it. Now is the time. CittaVR has many
components: a <strong>Debian package</strong> with scripts to communicate with the
internal manager to instantiate new objects and <strong>two Unity packages</strong>,
one for the core and another with common assets.</p>
<p>The <strong>Debian package</strong> could be installed using the
<a href="http://pike.esi.uclm.es/">Pike repository</a> (visit the link for
instructions), just like any other package:</p>
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>sudo apt install cittavr-unity</pre>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Unity packages</strong> could be downloaded from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/arco_group/cittavr-unity">CittaVR
repository</a>, under the
<code>Downloads</code> section. For convenience, I put here the links to the
<strong>latest versions</strong>, just click to download and save them.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/arco_group/cittavr-unity/downloads/cittavr-core-20200217.unitypackage">CittaVR Core - Unity
package</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/arco_group/cittavr-unity/downloads/cittavr-assets-20200217.unitypackage">CittaVR Assets - Unity
package</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you can import both packages into your project, using the same procedure as
before, ot just <strong>drag and drop</strong> the package inside the Assets folder of your
Unity Editor. Add first the <strong>CittaVR Core</strong> package:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20install%20core.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: installing CittaVR Core</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>On drop, it will show a new window to select what components you want to
include. Confirm that <strong>all is selected</strong> and press on import. Repeat the <strong>same
process</strong> to include the package &lsquo;<em>CittaVR Assets</em>&rsquo; you downloaded earlier.</p>
<p>The final step to conclude your setup is <strong>adding</strong> to your scene an
instance of the <strong>CittaVRApp prefab</strong>, which is needed to initialize
all the internal runtime of CittaVR. Go to <code>Assets &gt; CittaVR</code> folder
inside your project tab on the Unity Editor. There you should find a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html">prefab</a> called
<code>CittaVRApp</code> (the blue 3D box), drag it and drop into your <em>Hierarchy</em>
tab (and save the scene!).</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20add%20cittavr%20prefab.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: adding the CittaVR prefab</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Now, you can press <strong>play</strong> on Unity, and (if everything went ok),
your CittaVR manager should have <strong>registered</strong> correctly on the given
IDM router. You may see messages like these:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/idm%20-%20adv%20of%20cittavr.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>IDM: CittaVR manager advertisement</p>
  </div>
  
</div>



  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">

  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: starting messages of CittaVR</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Press stop, we are going to <strong>add some objects</strong> to the scene!</p>
<h1 id="static-instantiating">Static instantiating</h1>
<p>In the folder <code>Assets &gt; Resources &gt; CittaVR</code> you will find some more
prefabs. These are the objects that come <strong>bundled with CittaVR</strong>. Of
course, you are not limited to use only these, later we will
see how to create new ones, but as a starting point they will do.</p>
<p>Depending on the version you downloaded, there will be more or less
available assets. As of writing this document, there were: a <em>street
lamp</em>, a <em>traffic lights</em> and a <em>proximity sensor</em>. Let&rsquo;s <strong>add the
street lamp</strong> first.</p>
<p>The process is <strong>exactly the same</strong> used to add the <code>CittaVRApp</code>: just
<strong>grab</strong> the <code>StreetLamp</code> prefab and <strong>put</strong> it on your scene,
wherever you want. After that, you may see something like this:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20street%20lamp%20added.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: adding a new StreetLamp asset</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Well, OK. Maybe I&rsquo;ve changed some <em>little</em> things (I&rsquo;ve added a plane as a
floor, reduced the light intensity and switched on the Street Lamp), but you get
the idea, <strong>there is a street lamp</strong> on my scene, as should be in yours! Now,
you can press <strong>play</strong> again and your street lamp will be ready for action. You
may see a warning message like this:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20error%20no%20idm%20address.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: running without IDM address</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>The reason is that you <strong>didn&rsquo;t set</strong> a valid IDM address for this object. In
order to be reachable, or to know the source of a virtual event, every object in
CittaVR <strong>should have</strong> an IDM <strong>address</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t set it, CittaVR will
automatically choose one from the address pool (in this case, the next free
address: <code>0A01C17400000003</code>. If you want to set it, go to the object inspector
(right side in the above picture), and find the <code>Street Lamp (Script)</code>
component. There, you should see two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IDM Address</code></strong>, which is the field we need to change, the address
of this object for everyone else (including the outside world!)</li>
<li><strong><code>Citisim ID</code></strong>, this is an internal identifier, used for dynamic
instantiating, don&rsquo;t to worry about it now.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to change the <strong>IDM Address</strong> field, add a valid address, in the same domain
that your router, like <code>0A01C17400101234</code>. Then, if you press <strong>play</strong> again,
you will get rid of that warning. One way or the other, the object should have
been <strong>advertised</strong> on your IDM router, like this:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/idm%20-%20adv%20of%20street%20lamp.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>IDM: advertisement of the new Street Lamp</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Now, you can <strong>change its status</strong> from inside and outside Unity. From inside,
just <strong>click</strong> on the street lamp head, and it should toggle the lamp status. To
change it from outside, you must know that this lamp implements the <em>Smart
Transducer</em> interface <code>st::IBool</code>, so you need a client that uses this
interface. For instance, the Debian package <code>smart-transducer</code> provides a
<strong>command line tool</strong> that could be used for this purpose. To reach the object
<strong>directly</strong>, use the proxy that you saw on the advertisement:</p>
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>st-client -t bool -p &#34;0A01C17400101234 -t:tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9001&#34; 1
st-client -t bool -p &#34;0A01C17400101234 -t:tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9001&#34; 0</pre>
</div>
<p>But, if you want to <strong>use IDM</strong> (which is, by the way, the <strong>proper</strong>
method), you will use the router&rsquo;s endpoints and the object&rsquo;s address,
like this:</p>
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>st-client -t bool -p &#34;0A01C17400101234 -t:tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6140&#34; 1
st-client -t bool -p &#34;0A01C17400101234 -t:tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6140&#34; 0</pre>
</div>
<p>In this case, you will also see how the <strong>router forwards</strong> these
messages to the proper destination:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/idm%20-%20forwarding.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>IDM: forwarding messages to the lamp</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>What is more, this object also implements the interface <code>st::Linkable</code>, so you
can set another object as its <strong>observer</strong> (or link), and when the lamp changes
its state, it will <strong>notify</strong> the new state to this observer. Also, this lamp
could be the observer of some other object. <strong>Let&rsquo;s do it!</strong></p>
<h1 id="dynamic-instantation">Dynamic instantation</h1>
<p>We will use one of the other prefabs that come with CittaVR Assets: the
<strong>proximity sensor</strong>. The scene could be the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, we need a proximity sensor that <strong>detects</strong> a new car, and then <strong>switches
on</strong> the street lamp. This sensor implements the interface <code>st::Linkable</code>, and
sends events using <code>st::IBool</code>, which is the same interface implemented by the
<em>StreetLamp</em> object. We can just connect one to the other.</p>
<p>If you go to the <code>Assets &gt; Resources &gt; CittaVR</code>, there should be a
<code>ProximitySensor</code> prefab. You could just add it to your scene, as we
did earlier, but we want to do it <strong>differently, in a dynamic way</strong>
(i.e: having the whole scene <strong>running</strong>).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  Note:
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To achieve this, first thing you need to do is to press <strong>play</strong> on the Unity
editor, as we need the <em>CittaVRApp</em> running. Then, open a terminal window, and
use the <code>cittavr</code> companion <strong>tool</strong> to add the asset. You need to specify your
<strong>project folder</strong> (the Unity project root folder), the <strong>name</strong> of the asset
and the <strong>position</strong> in the scene to place it. For instance:</p>
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>cittavr . --add-asset CittaVR/ProximitySensor --pos 0 3.5 0 90</pre>
</div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  Note:
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of course, you can use the supplied <strong>Ice interface</strong> directly from your program
to achieve the same result. In any case, the proximity sensor should be
displayed like a <strong>red box</strong> (you will see it in the game tab and also in the
scene editor tab):</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20proximity%20sensor.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Proximity Sensor: normal appearance</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>You may don&rsquo;t want to see this red box, so just uncheck the <code>Mesh Renderer</code>
option of the proximity sensor prefab (remember, if you want to make this change
permanent, add the prefab to the scene statically):</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20disable%20render%20proximity%20sensor.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Proximity Sensor: disabling the red box</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Now, when some object <strong>collides</strong> with this one, it will emit a message to its
observer (if no observer is set, nothing will be done). Note that the colliding
object should be a <strong>Rigid Body</strong>, and also have <strong>some type of collider</strong> on
it. So its time to add the object that will <strong>activate</strong> this sensor, just to
test if everything works. Press <strong>Stop</strong> on your player, and add a cube or
something that will collide with your sensor. Now, you can press play, and add
the proximity sensor again, using the <code>cittavr</code> tool.</p>
<p>But, if you expect the light to switch on, you will get disappointed! :) Why?
Because we didn&rsquo;t <strong>connect</strong> both objects (yet). Its a simple step. Open a new
terminal window, and use a tool called <code>st-link-to</code>, available on the
<code>smart-transducer</code> Debian package. It needs <strong>two</strong> parameters: first, the proxy
of <strong>your observable</strong> object (which is the source of the events), and second,
the IDM address of <strong>the observer</strong> (that is the object that will receive the events).
In this example, the observable object is the proximity sensor (IDM:
<code>0A01C17400000003</code>) and the observer is your street lamp (IDM:
<code>0A01C17400101234</code>).</p>
<p>So, to <strong>connect both</strong> elements using the router endpoints, run the following
command:</p>
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>st-link-to &#39;0A01C17400000003 -t:tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6140&#39; 0A01C17400101234</pre>
</div>
<p>Now, when the sensor <strong>detects some collision</strong>, it will <strong>invoke</strong>
the street lamp, which will power on. Later, if the sensor <strong>stops
detecting</strong> the collider, it will <strong>also notify</strong> the lamp, but with a
delay of 8 seconds (which is the default value of the prefab).</p>

  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Test: the yellow cube just collided with the sensor</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>The next big thing to achieve is the task of creating <strong>new CittaVR</strong>
compliant assets. This will be analyzed in the following section.</p>
<h1 id="creating-a-new-cittavr-asset">Creating a new CittaVR Asset</h1>
<p>A CittaVR asset is usually a <strong>prefab</strong> which provides the mesh,
materials, textures, scripts and other components in a single
unit. Thus, you just need to add it to your scene, and maybe change
some settings.</p>
<p>In this section, we will create a <strong>new asset</strong>, step by step. It will
be a level crossing, and will provide an interface to set its state (up
or down).</p>
<h2 id="model-in-blender">Model in Blender</h2>
<p>Well, this part is very &lsquo;simple&rsquo;: just open Blender and <strong>create the
model</strong> you wish. Take note that you will import it into Unity, so you
must know the <strong>limitations and caveats</strong> it has (which will not be
enumerated here). If your model is simple, you won&rsquo;t have any
problem. Even some modifiers work out of the box, like basic textures
do (the UV mappings are also imported correctly). Specific <strong>shaders</strong>
or node materials are <strong>not supported</strong>, you must create them inside
Unity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  Note:
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For this example, I&rsquo;ve created a <strong>simple barrier</strong>, like this:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/blender%20-%20basic%20barrier.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Blender: a basic train barrier</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<h2 id="creating-the-prefab">Creating the prefab</h2>
<p>Add your model to the assets folder of your Unity project, and then to
your scene, to check if <strong>everything is correct</strong>. Adjust your model
materials, and textures, and add whatever component you need.</p>
<p>Now, to create your prefab, just <strong>drag the model</strong> you added in your scene
(which you have modified, adding components, etc.), <strong>drop it</strong> on your
assets folder and select <code>Original Prefab</code>:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20create%20prefab.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: populating the prefab with your instance</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Now, you have an object which will be the template used to instantiate
new objects. Note that you still <strong>need to preserve</strong> the original
model imported from blender, and also the textures and associated
scripts.</p>
<h2 id="companion-c-script">Companion C# script</h2>
<p>Up to now, your asset is not integrated into CittaVR in any way. So,
<strong>create</strong> a new empty <strong>C# script</strong>, and open it with your editor.</p>
<p>First of all, you will need to create a new class, that inherits from
<code>CittaVR.AssetManager</code> (which is a subclass of <code>MonoBehaviour</code>
). Among other tasks, this class will be used to instantiate your
<strong>Ice servant</strong>, so you must implement a method called
<code>create_servant</code>, which has the following signature:</p>
<div class="app-skin">
  <div class="filename">
    
      snippet.cs
    
  </div>
  
  <pre><code class='language-cs'>public abstract Ice.Object create_servant(
    GameObject obj,
    ConcurrentQueue&lt;GUITask&gt; task_queue,
    Ice.ObjectPrx router);</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The given parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>GameObject obj</code></strong>: the actual
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html">GameObject</a>
to which this script is attached to.</li>
<li><strong><code>ConcurrentQueue&lt;GUITask&gt; task_queue</code></strong>: this is a queue of
<code>GUITask</code>, used to execute drawing functions on the GUI thread. If
your servant wants to modify the scene on runtime, this is the way
to achieve it.</li>
<li><strong><code>Ice.ObjectPrx router</code></strong>: the IDM router that you have to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, on this method, you should <strong>create and return</strong> an instance of your
servant. For example, this asset will use the <code>st::IBool</code> interface, so I create
my servant as this:</p>
<div class="app-skin">
  <div class="filename">
    
      snippet.cs
    
  </div>
  
  <pre><code class='language-cs'>class LevelCrossingServant : st.IBoolDisp_ {
    private static ILogger logger = Debug.unityLogger;

    private GameObject _obj;
    private ConcurrentQueue&lt;GUITask&gt; _task_queue;
    private Ice.ObjectPrx _router;
    private string _observer;
    private string _source;

    private Transform _barrier;
    private Quaternion _originalRot;

    public LevelCrossingServant(
              GameObject obj, ConcurrentQueue&lt;GUITask&gt; task_queue,
              Ice.ObjectPrx router, string source) {

        this._obj = obj;
        this._task_queue = task_queue;
        this._router = router;
        this._source = source;

        this._barrier = _obj.transform.GetChild(0);
        this._originalRot = _barrier.rotation;
    }

    public override void set(bool value, string source, Current current=null) {
        // enqueue UI update
        _task_queue.Enqueue((mb) =&gt; {
             _barrier.rotation =
                _originalRot * Quaternion.AngleAxis(value ? 90: 0, Vector3. up);
        });
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ve implemented the <code>set()</code> method. What it does is to <strong>enqueue an
operation of update</strong> inside the GUI thread, to just rotate the barrier to one
side or the other.</p>
<p>With this class, I&rsquo;ve implemented the <code>create_servant()</code> method as follows:</p>
<div class="app-skin">
  <div class="filename">
    
      snippet.cs
    
  </div>
  
  <pre><code class='language-cs'>public class LevelCrossing : CittaVR.AssetManager {
    private LevelCrossingServant _servant;

    public override Ice.Object create_servant(
            GameObject obj, ConcurrentQueue&lt;GUITask&gt; task_queue,
            Ice.ObjectPrx router) {

        _servant = new LevelCrossingServant(
            obj, task_queue, router, IDMAddress);
        return _servant;
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now, of course, don&rsquo;t forget to <strong>add this script</strong> as a component of
your prefab. And, if you go to the inspector tab, you will see some
familiar properties on this script: the <strong>IDM Address</strong> and the less
used <strong>Citisim ID</strong>.</p>
<p>To test the script, create an <strong>instance</strong> of your prefab, set the IDM address,
and press play. You should see the advertisement of this object in the router
output, and also should be able to change its state using the
<code>st-client</code> again.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-your-asset">Exporting your asset</h2>
<p>If you want to use this asset on another project, you should <strong>export
it</strong> as a Unity Package. There are two ways of doing this: using the
<strong>contextual menu</strong> of the editor, or by <strong>command line</strong>. I prefer
the later, because you can put it inside a <code>Makefile</code>, and generate
the package very easily, but this is a matter of preference.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to export your asset, I recommend you to make <strong>an
specific folder</strong> for it, and then put every dependency that you want
to include in your package inside that folder. In our example, it
should be like this:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20asset%20hierarchy.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: folders for our asset</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Then, to export it using the editor, just click over that folder, and
select <code>Export Package</code>. Unity automatically will select all
dependencies of this asset, which includes CittaVR and many other
things that you don&rsquo;t want to provide, so in the window that appears,
uncheck the box <code>Include dependencies</code> (at the bottom):</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/unity%20-%20export%20unselect%20depends.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Unity: on export, don&#39;t include dependencies</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>Click on <code>Export</code> and save the package wherever you want. It&rsquo;s also a
good idea to <strong>create a new Unity project</strong> and check that everything
worked fine.</p>
<p>If you want to do this process but from the <strong>command line</strong> interface, open a
terminal and go to your project folder. If you are using the new unity-hub (like
me), then you may need to create an alias for the binary <code>unity</code> to the location
you specified on setup. For example, I have all the unity installs in the folder
<code>~/use/share/unity</code>, so in my example, I will create the following alias:</p>
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>alias unity=&#39;~/usr/share/unity/2019.3.0f6/Editor/Unity&#39;</pre>
</div>
<p>Then, to create the package, execute the following command:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  Note:
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="app-skin shell">
  <div class="filename">console</div>
  
  <pre class=shell>unity -quit -nographics -batchmode \
        -projectPath &#34;$(pwd)&#34; \
        -exportPackage Assets/LevelCrossing \
        &#34;$(pwd)/cittavr-level-crossing.unitypackage&#34;</pre>
</div>
<h1 id="compiling-slices-with-unity">Compiling Slices with Unity</h1>
<p>In many cases, you will need to use your own Slice interfaces, to
provide a custom servant or to implement two or more interfaces in the
same class. Then, you will need to <strong>compile the slices</strong> to C#, using
the Slice translators. Again, you have two options: <strong>install the Ice
3.7</strong> compilers on your system, and compile directly from the command
line interface, or use the <strong>Slice4Unity</strong> package. Here we will see
the later method.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and download the <code>Slice4Unity</code> package:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/arco_group/slice4unity/downloads/slice4unity-latest.unitypackage">Slice4Unity package from
bitbucket</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And <strong>add it</strong> to your project, as any other asset.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  Note:
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After the installation, you can now select any <code>.ice</code> file, and the
inspector will show you a button to <strong>compile the slice</strong>, like this:</p>

  
  
  



  
  


<div class="polaroid">
  <img src='/cittavr/images/_index/slice4unity%20-%20compile%20button.png' />
  
  <div class="polaroid-caption">
    <p>Slice4Unity: inspecting an slice file</p>
  </div>
  
</div>


<p>When you press the button, it will create a folder called <code>Generated</code> with the
generated code for that slice interface. Nowadays, there is no other option,
like support for including other directories, but I&rsquo;m working on it :D</p>
