      <description>Overview In ARCO Research Group, in the context of the European project H2020 Shapes, we are working in a set of solutions to encourage the active ageing and improve the health condition at an advanced age. One of these solutions is a fall detection system that will allow us to automatically detect when a person has fell, in order to provide a prompt response. The system here presented could be a very powerful and useful tool, taking into account that falls are the leading cause of accidental death.</description>
